        A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit.[1] Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords

   PERSONAL<br><br>
   Personal banking is a type of banking service and product line offered by banks to retail customers, that is consumers rather than businesses, intermediaries and institutions. Banks worldwide offer personal banking products that typically include savings and transaction facilities such as a bank transaction account, debit cards/EFT, an interest bearing floating account (savings account) and a fixed interest deposit account for a specific agreed period (certificates of deposit / term deposit) which can vary according to the bank. In addition it also includes debt facilities such as loans, mortgages and credit cards.
